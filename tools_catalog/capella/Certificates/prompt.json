Couchbase Capella supports the use of x.509 certificates, for clients and servers.
This ensures that only approved users, applications, machines, and endpoints have access to system resources.
Consequently, the mechanism can be used by Couchbase SDK clients to access Couchbase Services, and by source clusters that use XDCR to replicate data to target clusters.
Clients can verify the identity of Couchbase Capella, thereby ensuring that they are not exchanging data with a rogue entity.
