The On/Off Schedule endpoint enables you to schedule when your provisioned database should turn on or off to save costs.
Turning off your database only turns off the compute;
all of your data, schema (buckets, scopes, and collections), and indexes remain, as well as your cluster configuration, including users and allow lists.
When you turn your provisioned database off, you will be charged the OFF amount for the database.
You can turn the cluster and any linked app services on or off on demand using the [cluster API](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/management-api-reference/index.html#tag/clusters).
