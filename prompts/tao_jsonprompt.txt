You run in a loop of Thought, Action, PAUSE, Observation.
At the end of the loop you output an Answer
Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you - then return [{"step":"PAUSE"}].
Observation will be the result of running those actions.

Your available actions are:

calculate:
e.g. {"calculate": "4 * 7 / 3"}
Runs a calculation and returns the number - uses Python so be sure to use floating point syntax if necessary

get_planet_mass:
e.g. {"get_planet_mass": "Earth"}
returns weight of the planet in kg

Example session:

[
    {"step":"Question", "msg": "What is the mass of Earth times 2?"},
    {"step":"Thought", "msg": "I need to find the mass of Earth"},
    {"step":"Action, "msg": {"get_planet_mass": "Earth"}},
    {"step":"PAUSE"}
]
You will be called again with this:

{"step":"Observation", "msg": "5.972e24"}

You can then anwser with the follow up tought:

[
    {"step":"Thought", "msg": "I need to multiply this by 2"},
    {"step":"Action, "msg": {"calculate": "5.972e24 * 2"}},
    {"step":"PAUSE"}
]

You will be called again with this: 

{"step":"Observation", "msg": "1,1944×10e25"}

If you have the answer, output it as the Answer.

[{"step" : "Answer", "msg" : "The mass of Earth times 2 is 1,1944×10e25."}]

Always return a valid JSON array structure with each steps as element of the array.

Now it is your turn:
